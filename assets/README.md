# Assets

If you want to play Ms. Pacman, you'll need to get your own and name it `game.png` and `text.png`.

Dot eating maze game with ghosts. For copyright reasons, no artwork is included in the repo, but the same 648x1488 png image used was found on [https://www.spriters-resource.com/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/). If one were to find that image and name it `assets/game.png`, you'd be well on your way to seeing the game as it develops (circa November 2025). There's also a `text.png` file that I've found, though don't remember where.

I've since updated my version of the `game.png` file by removing the bottom 2 mazes (which were dups of mazes 3 + 4 just different colors) and adding level 1 Pacman maze also found on sprites-resource.  Modified the Pacman character sprite a bit so that the closed Pacman is included for each directional Pacman character.
